# 3FIT

3FIT - Gym & Health Clubs Subscription Platform Engine based on the Optimism Blockchain for managing Gym and Health Club subscriptions via NFTs.
The inception of Idea behind 3FIT comes from the problem of solving intellectual property protection in the form of subscriptions. The team at 3FIT describes the solution as one stop platform for managing your access to any online or offline service via blockchain. 
Given the advent of Web3 and decentralisation, treating NFT ownership data laws seems to be the perfect way to blend in with authorised access. With all transactions, including Buying/Selling/Transferring ownership of NFTs directly on blockchain, the 3FIT team plans to bring this openness to the world of traditional access mechanisms.

### Technical Specs
1. GymStore Smart Contract: This is deployed on the Aurora blockchain for managing the Gym and Health Club by their Owners. Every Gym/Health Club is trated as a ERC721 token and the owner of the gym/health club has full control over its behaviour. 

2. GymSubscription Smart Contract: This is again deployed on the Aurora Blockchain for managing the Gym's Membership Subscriptions available in various time ranges. Users can purchase these membership subscriptions that are then issued as the user's ERC721 token. This contract also controls the access to any Gym/Health Club via interation with the blockchain.
