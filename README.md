# 3FIT

3FIT - Gym & Health Clubs Subscription Platform Engine based on the Aurora Blockchain for managing Gym and Health Club subscriptions via NFTs.
The inception of Idea behind 3FIT comes from the problem of solving intellectual property protection in the form of subscriptions. The team at 3FIT describes the solution as one stop platform for managing your access to any online or offline service via blockchain. 
Given the advent of Web3 and decentralisation, treating NFT ownership data laws seems to be the perfect way to blend in with authorised access. With all transactions, including Buying/Selling/Transferring ownership of NFTs directly on the Aurora blockchain, the 3FIT team plans to bring this openness to the world of traditional access mechanisms.
